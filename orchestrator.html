  <!-- WHAT TRAINSTORM DOES -->
  <section class="section section-light" id="orchestrator">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Trainstorm.ai / Orchestrator Model</h2>
      <p>
        Trainstorm.ai is built around a simple but powerful idea: <strong>AI transformation fails when it starts with tools instead of people.</strong> Our flagship framework, <strong>Orchestrator™</strong>, is a three-layer ecosystem that aligns humans and AI so that both can do their best work.
      </p>

      <div class="three-column-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>1. Identity</h3>
          <p>
            Who do your people believe they are in an AI-shaped world? We start with the human layer—mindset, identity, and how people locate their value when intelligent systems enter the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            This layer reduces fear, increases curiosity, and creates psychological space for change.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>2. Skills</h3>
          <p>
            Once the identity shift is in place, we build real, vendor-agnostic capabilities: prompt chains, structured outputs, content pipelines, persona-driven design, and AI-assisted asset creation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participants learn to <strong>orchestrate AI</strong>, not just “ask it for stuff.”
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>3. Systems</h3>
          <p>
            At the organizational level, we help teams design and implement AI-enabled learning systems: workflows, governance, automation, metrics, and scalable architectures.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is lasting capability, not another pilot that fades out.

  <!-- IDENTITY INTENSIVE -->

            A 4-hour live experience that creates the <strong>human who can actually thrive with AI</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Identity Intensive is the “front door” to Orchestrator. It’s designed for broad participation but is especially powerful for Learning &amp; Development, HR, and creative/knowledge teams.
          </p>
          <p>In this session, participants:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Examine their real fears and assumptions about AI</li>
            <li>Reframe AI as an amplifier, not a replacement</li>
            <li>Reconnect to their unique value in an AI-augmented landscape</li>
            <li>Craft a more hopeful, grounded narrative about their future</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The session concludes with something practical and concrete: each participant leaves with a <strong>configured GPT “coach”</strong> that reflects their goals, values, and preferred working style.
          </p>
          <p>
            That coach becomes an ongoing companion for experimentation, reflection, and growth—extending the impact of the session far beyond four hours.

          <p class="section-lede">
            Trainstorm.ai sits at the intersection of <strong>learning design, enterprise reality, and frontier AI.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The company grew out of years of work in complex, regulated environments—pharma, healthcare, and large corporate ecosystems—combined with hands-on experimentation in AI pipelines, prompt chains, and automated content production.
          </p>
          <p>
            That work led to a simple observation: the biggest barrier to AI wasn’t technology. It was how humans understood themselves in relation to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Orchestrator is the response: a way to help people transform first, then build skills, then build systems.
