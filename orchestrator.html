  <!-- PROBLEM / CONTEXT -->
  <section class="section section-light" id="why">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>AI Is Moving Fast. Your People Are Human.</h2>
      <p>
        AI is no longer a future topic—it’s a daily reality. Tools are evolving faster than job descriptions, and most organizations are scrambling to “roll out AI” with pilots, platforms, and policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the real bottleneck isn’t tools or training. It’s identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        People don’t resist AI because they’re incapable. They resist because they’re unsure what it means for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who they are at work</li>
        <li>What they’re valued for</li>
        <li>Whether they can keep up</li>
        <li>How much of their expertise still matters</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If that identity gap isn’t addressed, no amount of “AI skills training” will stick.
      </p>
    </div>

  <!-- WHAT ORCHESTRATOR DOES -->
  <section class="section" id="what">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>What Orchestrator™ Is</h2>
      <p>
        The Orchestrator Identity Intensive is a guided, interactive 4-hour experience that helps participants shift from:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>“AI is going to replace me”</strong> → to → <strong>“AI can amplify me.”</strong></li>
        <li><strong>“I’m not technical enough”</strong> → to → <strong>“I can learn to orchestrate this.”</strong></li>
        <li><strong>“I’m trying to hold onto the old model”</strong> → to → <strong>“I’m building the next one.”</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It’s not a tools demo. It’s not a product pitch. It’s a carefully designed space where people can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Process real fears and uncertainty about AI</li>
        <li>See new possibilities in their role and career</li>
        <li>Reframe AI as a partner, not a threat</li>
        <li>Connect emotionally and intellectually to a bigger future</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And then we do something unique: each participant leaves with a <strong>configured personal GPT coach</strong> that embodies their new identity and supports ongoing behavior change.

  <!-- WHY START WITH IDENTITY -->
  <section class="section section-light" id="identity">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Why Start with Identity?</h2>
      <p>
        Most AI initiatives start with tools, platforms, or policies. The result is predictable:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A small group of early adopters experiments</li>
        <li>Most people wait, watch, and worry</li>
        <li>Leadership grows frustrated with “slow adoption”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Orchestrator flips the sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        We start with identity—how people see themselves, what they believe they’re capable of, and how they locate their value in an AI-shaped world. Once this shifts, skills training and workflow changes don’t feel threatening. They feel natural.
      </p>
      <p>
        For organizations, this means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Higher engagement with subsequent AI training</li>
        <li>Faster adoption of new tools and workflows</li>
        <li>Less resistance, more experimentation</li>
        <li>A healthier, more honest conversation about change</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- BEYOND L&D -->
  <section class="section" id="beyond">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Starting in L&amp;D, Designed for Everyone</h2>
      <p>
        The founding story of Orchestrator sits in Learning &amp; Development: the place where training, culture, and capability intersect. That’s where we begin, because L&amp;D teams are being asked to “solve AI” for everyone else while also navigating their own transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the core Orchestrator identity framework is not limited to L&amp;D. The same structure applies to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Leaders responsible for AI strategy and change</li>
        <li>Creative and design teams</li>
        <li>Technical and non-technical knowledge workers</li>
        <li>Any group facing a rapid shift in tools, expectations, or business models</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As the Orchestrator ecosystem grows, this 4-hour foundation becomes the “front door” to more technical tracks and organizational programs—for those who want to go deeper.
      </p>
    </div>

  <!-- HOW IT FITS IN ECOSYSTEM -->
  <section class="section section-accent" id="ecosystem">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>What Comes After the Identity Intensive?</h2>
      <p>
        The Identity Intensive is designed to stand on its own and also serve as a launchpad. For organizations that want to build real AI capability, Orchestrator offers follow-on paths such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical Tracks</strong> – teaching teams how to design prompt chains, pipelines, and AI-assisted workflows.</li>
        <li><strong>Systems Bootcamps</strong> – helping L&amp;D and content teams build end-to-end AI-driven production systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise Partnerships</strong> – working with leadership to install Orchestrator as part of the organization’s long-term AI transformation strategy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But it all starts with a room full of humans, four hours, and a structured conversation about who they are becoming.

  <!-- FAQ -->
  <section class="section section-light" id="faq">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Is this a technical AI training?</h3>
      <p>
        No. The Identity Intensive is deliberately non-technical. We may show AI in action, but the focus is on mindset, identity, and how participants relate to their work in an AI-enabled world. Technical skills can be layered in afterward, once the human foundation is in place.
      </p>

      <h3>Do participants need prior AI experience?</h3>
      <p>
        No. The session is designed to meet people where they are—whether they’re early adopters or deeply skeptical. Mixed groups actually work very well; the structure allows everyone to see themselves somewhere in the conversation.
      </p>

      <h3>Is this only for Learning &amp; Development teams?</h3>
      <p>
        L&amp;D is a natural starting point, but the framework applies across functions. We can tailor examples and narratives to leaders, creative teams, or broader knowledge-worker populations.
      </p>

      <h3>What platform is used for the GPT coach?</h3>
      <p>
        We work within the organization’s preferred AI environment where possible (e.g., approved corporate GPT instances). If no platform exists yet, we can provide guidance and interim options for secure experimentation.
      </p>

      <h3>How do we measure impact?</h3>
      <p>
        We typically combine participant feedback, qualitative shifts in language and behavior, and follow-up engagement with subsequent AI initiatives. For organizations moving into deeper Orchestrator tracks, we can also define specific behavioral and productivity metrics.
